## About <a name = "about"></a>

This buildpack downloads and extracts the [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) binaries and works on `heroku-18`, `heroku-20`, `heroku-22`, and `heroku-24` stacks.

- This buildpack downloads wkhtmltopdf v0.12.6.1-2 for `heroku-22` and `heroku-24`, v0.12.6-1 for `heroku-20`, and v0.12.5 for `heroku-18`.
- The buildpack can bypass stack detection if the URL to the wkhtmltopdf binary is provided through an Aptfile.

### Ownership Update

This repository was originally created and maintained by [Rohan Debroy](https://github.com/RohanDebroy). As the original author is no longer maintaining the project (This repository has been archived by the owner on Aug 10, 2024. It is now read-only.), I [John Paul Garland w/ Forest of Knowledge Inc.](https://github.com/johnpg82) have taken over the repository to continue its development and support. In this latest update, I've added support for the `heroku-24` stack to ensure compatibility with the latest Heroku environments.
